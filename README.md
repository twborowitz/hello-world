Intro to github

My name is Tyrel Borowitz. 
I am 30 years old and live in Camarillo, CA with my wife and daughter (2yo). We currently live at my parents' house. 
We are hoping to move to New England in the near future.
I am employed at MadeWest Brewing Co. but am earning this degree to learn new skills and gain a new career. 
I have always had a love for maps and science, which is what drew me to GIS. I did not have any experience with GIS before attending the MS-GIST program at the U of A. 
Facts about me: 
I am red-green colorblind.
I enjoy hiking and camping. 
I worry too much about what others think. 
I performed in an improv group for about 7 years in and after college.
